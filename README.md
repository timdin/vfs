# vfs
virtual file system assignment

# setting up

run the following command to setup the database which will be used by the virtual file system

``` bash
 > docker compose up
```

# for a better experience
run the following command first

``` bash
 > alias myvfs="$PWD/main"
```

This will save some time typing ./main ;)

Also, don't worry about polluting your env, this will only work under the current command line session
